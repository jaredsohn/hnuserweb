This thread had been talking about how one should take money from an accelerator if it offers a greater chance of success compared to the dilution it results in; it hasn&#x27;t compared the merits of YC versus other accelerators at all.  Your earlier comment mentioned how rational the decision was, but I&#x27;m saying that it isn&#x27;t rational based on what was written earlier in the thread since other programs weren&#x27;t taken into account at all.<p>That said, based on my understanding of the accelerator space, I&#x27;d probably prefer YC to other options.  Some reasons you maybe would prefer something else (guessing) would be if it conflicts with an accelerator that is very domain specific, although I&#x27;m not sure if such a situation would happen that couldn&#x27;t be worked around.","Was Y Combinator Worth It?",null,null,"http://wiwillia.com/post/80862769673/was-y-combinator-worth-it",null,null,1395966575

So if you were writing code to gather contacts, you would be working on a backend portion of the frontend.","What is a Full Stack developer?

The frontend would be the part that interacts with the user (i.e. WinForms, Cocoa, GTK, etc. depending on your operating system and GUI library) and the backend would be code that interacts with the operating system, makes use of the network, manages the database, computes something interesting, etc.<p>A simple example would be to take a web project that you just built and bundle the backend and frontend together into an installer, have users download and install it, and only run it locally.  If you know a user's platform, you could conceivably replace individual web components with native ones.  Upon doing so, you have become a non-web full-stack developer.","What is a Full Stack developer?

"2013-03-01T05:54:57.000Z",4,,"Article text (there were also about three images):<p>Hackathons are bad for you.<p>I love developer communities. I love the spirit, the comradery and energy. But in the last couple of years or so, Hackthons have spread through the community like a plague. There are Hackathons around technologies, ideologies and everything in between. And I feel there is an urgent need to eradicate them.<p>Here is my main beef with Hackathon. Theyre encouraging and spreading a perverse culture of unhealthy lifestyle and unsustainable workflow which has been made popular by sensational media and film.<p>Heres a standard recipe for a Hackathon.<p>Gather a bunch of developers in a location.\nSupply them copious amounts of junk food, booze and caffeine.\nTell them to get cracking for 24hrs.\nSounds familiar?<p>Sleep<p>There is an almost masochistic take on sleep deprivation in the developer community. (It might be true with other professions, but lets focus on the devs.) Working late into the night and not sleeping for days is lauded and almost considered a necessity by many these days. Hackthons, many of which last 24hrs, only serve to glorify that.<p>It is well-known that sleep deprivation has only negative effects on health. Sadly, popular culture in the community has only strengthened the indifference towards health. Y-combinators popularized (and prefered?) archetype for founder/developers who eat ramen and code into the night, or the life of Mark Zuckerberg as showcased in the movie The Social Network only make things worse.<p>And leaving long-term health out of the equation, lack of sleep hasnt been known to improve your focus or the ability to be logical or creative, all of which are critical skills for developers.<p>When was the last time you wrote a piece of code while being totally sleep deprived, and looked at it after you woke up to say it was the most beautiful, elegant and awesome piece of code youve ever written?<p>A good nights rest and a fresh mind are critical for a good developer, thats one thing that Hackathons completely miss.<p>Food and Drink<p>Next to sleep, your body needs good fuel to keep going. And NO! I dont mean coffee. As much as I love my coffee, binging on coffee, red bull or is rarely good for focus. Not to mention alcohol, which makes matters worse.<p>Its a short-term vs long-term trade-off. Coffee (and possibly alcohol, although I am skeptical abt it), do help you feel more focused in the short-term. But both caffeine and alcohol are diuretics and only make you lose more water in the long-term. A dehydrated body isnt much of a help when you need your brain to focus and solve problems. When was the last time you saw an isotonic drink at a Hackathon?<p>Junk food isnt much of a help to that. I am not even going to touch on long-term effects of eating high carb diets. The usual Hackathon menu of pizza and candy is full of carbohydrates. While sugar highs are great for short-term focus (maybe??) you tend to feel hungry very quickly after a carb heavy meal. That only means you going around for another round of pizza/candy etc. Not really the best way to focus is it?<p>Sedentary lifestyle<p>More and more research is showing a link between a sitting lifestyle and health issues. Developers are unfortunate to have a job which is inherently sedentary. Hackthons again make it worse by inciting developers to sit at the same place for 24hrs. Im sure your back will thank you at the end of that!.<p>And whats worse is since most Hackathon are held on weekends, the one day you usually get to be active is also spent being sedentary.<p>Distraction<p>Hackathons are distraction. There are a ton of things going on. People are talking, discussing ideas, giving talks or just hanging out. All that is competing for your attention while you need to focus. Add caffeine to that mix and thats one hell of a party on thought in your mind. Noise cancelling headphones help, but then whats the point?<p>Solutions?<p>Im pretty sure there are better ways to organize hackthons. Having them over 2 days of 12hrs slots would be an idea, to combat sleep deprivation. Supplying and encouraging healthier eating and drinking options would be really useful. Fruits, nuts, and other healthy food are options. Similarly with drink, having access to isotonic drinks and lots of plain water should be a priority. Encouraging participants to do physical activities like calisthenics or just going out for walks on a regular schedule are options to consider.<p>But in the end, I really feel that Hackathons are beneficial less as a place and time to code out your next big idea, but more of a time to mingle and bond with the community. Its like a gathering of the tribe. And personally, there is more value in that than actually developing anything.<p>TL;DR; : Hackthons promote unhealthy lifestyle. If youre organizing one, urge your participants to hydrate regularly, eat healthy meals and take regular breaks where they do some type of physical activities.","Hackathons are bad for you","","","http://chinpen.net/blog/2013/02/hackathons-are-bad-for-you/",null,null,1362117297

"2012-07-19T10:14:19.000Z",6,,"I think you misread that article.  In the most basic sense, it isn't possible for Apple to get 44% profit margin when developers get 70%.<p>Here's how I understand the argument in the article (but keep in mind the numbers are as of 2010 so they aren't current.)<p>Basically, the article is saying that Apple claimed that developers earned $1 billion through 2010.  Since developers earn 70%, the total revenue coming into Apple would be a billion / .7 = 1.428 billion giving them a profit of $428 million (matching the figure in the article).  Then the article does some estimations about how much of that $428 million goes to the credit card company and is used for processing instead of being Apple's profit and calculates that Apple only gets 44% of their 30% as profit.  (Although comments on the article suggest that Apple might be able to get more favorable deals with the credit card company than what was used in the estimations.)<p>So if you trust the article's credit processing fee assumptions, then Apple gets $189 million of the $1.428 billion which is about 13%.  And if you factor in their costs for free apps ($81 million is cited in the article), the effective percentage becomes ((189-81)/189) * 13% = 7%.<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure these numbers are the right interpretation of the article.  Somebody in the comments mentioned that the 44% should be 14% net profit since it matches some graph that I haven't seen and that seems similar to the 13% I got in the above calculations.","Mozilla Wants Hundreds Of Thousands Of Firefox OS Developers","","","http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/mozilla-firefox-os-developer-86176",null,null,1342692859
