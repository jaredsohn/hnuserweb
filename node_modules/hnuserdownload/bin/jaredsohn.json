We will more carefully screen from now on.&quot;) and on their site (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/08/an-apology-from-techcrunch/\"

I love the spirit, the comradery and energy. But in the last couple of years or so, Hackthons have spread through the community like a plague. There are Hackathons around technologies, ideologies and everything in between. And I feel there is an urgent need to eradicate them.<p>Here is my main beef with Hackathon. Theyre encouraging and spreading a perverse culture of unhealthy lifestyle and unsustainable workflow which has been made popular by sensational media and film.<p>Heres a standard recipe for a Hackathon.<p>Gather a bunch of developers in a location.\nSupply them copious amounts of junk food, booze and caffeine.\nTell them to get cracking for 24hrs.\nSounds familiar?<p>Sleep<p>There is an almost masochistic take on sleep deprivation in the developer community. (It might be true with other professions, but lets focus on the devs.) Working late into the night and not sleeping for days is lauded and almost considered a necessity by many these days. Hackthons, many of which last 24hrs, only serve to glorify that.<p>It is well-known that sleep deprivation has only negative effects on health. Sadly, popular culture in the community has only strengthened the indifference towards health. Y-combinators popularized (and prefered?) archetype for founder/developers who eat ramen and code into the night, or the life of Mark Zuckerberg as showcased in the movie The Social Network only make things worse.<p>And leaving long-term health out of the equation, lack of sleep hasnt been known to improve your focus or the ability to be logical or creative, all of which are critical skills for developers.<p>When was the last time you wrote a piece of code while being totally sleep deprived, and looked at it after you woke up to say it was the most beautiful, elegant and awesome piece of code youve ever written?<p>A good nights rest and a fresh mind are critical for a good developer, thats one thing that Hackathons completely miss.<p>Food and Drink<p>Next to sleep, your body needs good fuel to keep going. And NO! I dont mean coffee. As much as I love my coffee, binging on coffee, red bull or is rarely good for focus. Not to mention alcohol, which makes matters worse.<p>Its a short-term vs long-term trade-off. Coffee (and possibly alcohol, although I am skeptical abt it), do help you feel more focused in the short-term. But both caffeine and alcohol are diuretics and only make you lose more water in the long-term. A dehydrated body isnt much of a help when you need your brain to focus and solve problems. When was the last time you saw an isotonic drink at a Hackathon?<p>Junk food isnt much of a help to that. I am not even going to touch on long-term effects of eating high carb diets. The usual Hackathon menu of pizza and candy is full of carbohydrates. While sugar highs are great for short-term focus (maybe??) you tend to feel hungry very quickly after a carb heavy meal. That only means you going around for another round of pizza/candy etc. Not really the best way to focus is it?<p>Sedentary lifestyle<p>More and more research is showing a link between a sitting lifestyle and health issues. Developers are unfortunate to have a job which is inherently sedentary. Hackthons again make it worse by inciting developers to sit at the same place for 24hrs. Im sure your back will thank you at the end of that!.<p>And whats worse is since most Hackathon are held on weekends, the one day you usually get to be active is also spent being sedentary.<p>Distraction<p>Hackathons are distraction. There are a ton of things going on. People are talking, discussing ideas, giving talks or just hanging out. All that is competing for your attention while you need to focus. Add caffeine to that mix and thats one hell of a party on thought in your mind. Noise cancelling headphones help, but then whats the point?<p>Solutions?<p>Im pretty sure there are better ways to organize hackthons. Having them over 2 days of 12hrs slots would be an idea, to combat sleep deprivation. Supplying and encouraging healthier eating and drinking options would be really useful. Fruits, nuts, and other healthy food are options. Similarly with drink, having access to isotonic drinks and lots of plain water should be a priority. Encouraging participants to do physical activities like calisthenics or just going out for walks on a regular schedule are options to consider.<p>But in the end, I really feel that Hackathons are beneficial less as a place and time to code out your next big idea, but more of a time to mingle and bond with the community. Its like a gathering of the tribe. And personally, there is more value in that than actually developing anything.<p>TL;DR; : Hackthons promote unhealthy lifestyle. If youre organizing one, urge your participants to hydrate regularly, eat healthy meals and take regular breaks where they do some type of physical activities.","num_comments":null,"story_id":5302940,"story_title":"Hackathons are bad for you","story_url":"http://chinpen.net/blog/2013/02/hackathons-are-bad-for-you/","parent_id":5303017,"created_at_i":1362117297,"_tags":["comment","author_jaredsohn","story_5302940"],"objectID":"5303030","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"url":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"author":{"value":"jaredsohn","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"comment_text":{"value":"Article text (there were also about three images):<p>Hackathons are bad for you.<p>I love developer communities.

Theyre encouraging and spreading a perverse culture of unhealthy lifestyle and unsustainable workflow which has been made popular by sensational media and film.<p>Heres a standard recipe for a Hackathon.<p>Gather a bunch of developers in a location.\nSupply them copious amounts of junk food, booze and caffeine.\nTell them to get cracking for 24hrs.\nSounds familiar?<p>Sleep<p>There is an almost masochistic take on sleep deprivation in the developer community. (It might be true with other professions, but lets focus on the devs.) Working late into the night and not sleeping for days is lauded and almost considered a necessity by many these days. Hackthons, many of which last 24hrs, only serve to glorify that.<p>It is well-known that sleep deprivation has only negative effects on health. Sadly, popular culture in the community has only strengthened the indifference towards health. Y-combinators popularized (and prefered?) archetype for founder/developers who eat ramen and code into the night, or the life of Mark Zuckerberg as showcased in the movie The Social Network only make things worse.<p>And leaving long-term health out of the equation, lack of sleep hasnt been known to improve your focus or the ability to be logical or creative, all of which are critical skills for developers.<p>When was the last time you wrote a piece of code while being totally sleep deprived, and looked at it after you woke up to say it was the most beautiful, elegant and awesome piece of code youve ever written?<p>A good nights rest and a fresh mind are critical for a good developer, thats one thing that Hackathons completely miss.<p>Food and Drink<p>Next to sleep, your body needs good fuel to keep going. And NO! I dont mean coffee. As much as I love my coffee, binging on coffee, red bull or is rarely good for focus. Not to mention alcohol, which makes matters worse.<p>Its a short-term vs long-term trade-off. Coffee (and possibly alcohol, although I am skeptical abt it), do help you feel more focused in the short-term. But both caffeine and alcohol are diuretics and only make you lose more water in the long-term. A dehydrated body isnt much of a help when you need your brain to focus and solve problems. When was the last time you saw an isotonic drink at a Hackathon?<p>Junk food isnt much of a help to that. I am not even going to touch on long-term effects of eating high carb diets. The usual Hackathon menu of pizza and candy is full of carbohydrates. While sugar highs are great for short-term focus (maybe??) you tend to feel hungry very quickly after a carb heavy meal. That only means you going around for another round of pizza/candy etc. Not really the best way to focus is it?<p>Sedentary lifestyle<p>More and more research is showing a link between a sitting lifestyle and health issues. Developers are unfortunate to have a job which is inherently sedentary. Hackthons again make it worse by inciting developers to sit at the same place for 24hrs. Im sure your back will thank you at the end of that!.<p>And whats worse is since most Hackathon are held on weekends, the one day you usually get to be active is also spent being sedentary.<p>Distraction<p>Hackathons are distraction. There are a ton of things going on. People are talking, discussing ideas, giving talks or just hanging out. All that is competing for your attention while you need to focus. Add caffeine to that mix and thats one hell of a party on thought in your mind. Noise cancelling headphones help, but then whats the point?<p>Solutions?<p>Im pretty sure there are better ways to organize hackthons. Having them over 2 days of 12hrs slots would be an idea, to combat sleep deprivation. Supplying and encouraging healthier eating and drinking options would be really useful. Fruits, nuts, and other healthy food are options. Similarly with drink, having access to isotonic drinks and lots of plain water should be a priority. Encouraging participants to do physical activities like calisthenics or just going out for walks on a regular schedule are options to consider.<p>But in the end, I really feel that Hackathons are beneficial less as a place and time to code out your next big idea, but more of a time to mingle and bond with the community. Its like a gathering of the tribe. And personally, there is more value in that than actually developing anything.<p>TL;DR; : Hackthons promote unhealthy lifestyle. If youre organizing one, urge your participants to hydrate regularly, eat healthy meals and take regular breaks where they do some type of physical activities.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_title":{"value":"Hackathons are bad for you","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_url":{"value":"http://chinpen.net/blog/2013/02/hackathons-are-bad-for-you/","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"created_at":"2013-03-01T00:52:51.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"jaredsohn","points":1,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"Check out Seamless (<a href=\"http://www.seamless.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.seamless.com/</a>) or do a TaskRabbit/Exec to get somebody to pick up the food for you.<p>Edit: Verified that the seamless link worked; don't know why that caused problems for you.","num_comments":null,"story_id":5301792,"story_title":"Products I Wish Existed","story_url":"https://medium.com/products-i-wish-existed","parent_id":5302072,"created_at_i":1362099171,"_tags":["comment","author_jaredsohn","story_5301792"],"objectID":"5302129","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"url":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"author":{"value":"jaredsohn","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"comment_text":{"value":"Check out Seamless (<a href=\"http://www.seamless.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.seamless.com/</a>) or do a TaskRabbit/Exec to get somebody to pick up the food for you.<p>Edit: Verified that the seamless link worked; don't know why that caused problems for you.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_title":{"value":"Products I Wish Existed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_url":{"value":"https://medium.com/products-i-wish-existed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"created_at":"2013-02-28T09:23:22.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"jaredsohn","points":3,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"Limit how much can be placed in localstorage regardless of site based on time.

The point is that some things not possible in other browsers' JavaScript APIs are possible if you create NPAPI extensions (although some things such as certain UI flexibility are only available in Firefox.)<p>Edit: You can also register protocol handlers via JavaScript, although they need to start with the string 'web+' which makes this less powerful than what is possible in Firefox.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_title":{"value":"Writing Browser Extensions - Comparing Firefox, Chrome and Opera","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_url":{"value":"http://blog.nparashuram.com/2011/10/writing-browser-extensions-comparing.html?hn","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"created_at":"2012-04-09T20:35:30.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"jaredsohn","points":5,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"My first thought in seeing this post was to make a site for finding babysitters but a quick search at google shows that many such sites already exist (although maybe there is a way to do it better.)","num_comments":null,"story_id":3818964,"story_title":"An Airbnb for Dogs Gets $3.4 Million in Funding","story_url":"http://allthingsd.com/20120409/woof-rover-com-fetches-3-4-million-to-be-airbnb-for-dogs/?mod=tweet","parent_id":3819033,"created_at_i":1334003730,"_tags":["comment","author_jaredsohn","story_3818964"],"objectID":"3819095","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"url":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"author":{"value":"jaredsohn","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"comment_text":{"value":"My first thought in seeing this post was to make a site for finding babysitters but a quick search at google shows that many such sites already exist (although maybe there is a way to do it better.)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_title":{"value":"An Airbnb for Dogs Gets $3.4 Million in Funding","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_url":{"value":"http://allthingsd.com/20120409/woof-rover-com-fetches-3-4-million-to-be-airbnb-for-dogs/?mod=tweet","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"created_at":"2012-04-09T20:28:45.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"jaredsohn","points":2,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"Another company in the space is dogvacay (<a href=\"http://dogvacay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dogvacay.com/</a>) which recently got a million dollars in funding (<a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9299700.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9299700.htm</a>)","num_comments":null,"story_id":3818964,"story_title":"An Airbnb for Dogs Gets $3.4 Million in Funding","story_url":"http://allthingsd.com/20120409/woof-rover-com-fetches-3-4-million-to-be-airbnb-for-dogs/?mod=tweet","parent_id":3818964,"created_at_i":1334003325,"_tags":["comment","author_jaredsohn","story_3818964"],"objectID":"3819067","_highlightResult":{"title":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"url":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"author":{"value":"jaredsohn","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"comment_text":{"value":"Another company in the space is dogvacay (<a href=\"http://dogvacay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dogvacay.com/</a>) which recently got a million dollars in funding (<a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9299700.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9299700.htm</a>)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_title":{"value":"An Airbnb for Dogs Gets $3.4 Million in Funding","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"story_url":{"value":"http://allthingsd.com/20120409/woof-rover-com-fetches-3-4-million-to-be-airbnb-for-dogs/?mod=tweet","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}}},{"created_at":"2012-04-09T20:01:19.000Z","title":"","url":"","author":"jaredsohn","points":4,"story_text":null,"comment_text":"If you want to create a cross-browser extension, you can use an API such as Kynetx, Webmynd, CrossRider, or KangoExtensions.

Here's my best guess as to why (which could possibly be useful in understanding why others do, too).<p>* Some sites (Netflix, banking sites, etc.) can be annoying to have to log back into and get to a certain page so I just keep them open.  Yes, some of those sites will expire the login anyway, but I don't know when I'll want to visit them again.<p>* Keeping tabs open just feels abundant and allows me to ignore having a certain discipline for awhile (closing tabs when done).  It kind of feels like opening the Sunday newspaper and tearing out each section and throwing them on the table.  Yes, it is a little messy, but it helps you feel good for awhile.  Further, at some point you can just discard it all and nothing was really lost beyond possibly feeling embarassed by people watching you or feeling inefficient.<p>* I think it also metaphorically better fits how I learn.  I like to build connections between my previous knowledge and things that I read.

Here's my best guess as to why (which could possibly be useful in understanding why others do, too).<p>* Some sites (Netflix, banking sites, etc.) can be annoying to have to log back into and get to a certain page so I just keep them open.  Yes, some of those sites will expire the login anyway, but I don't know when I'll want to visit them again.<p>* Keeping tabs open just feels abundant and allows me to ignore having a certain discipline for awhile (closing tabs when done).  It kind of feels like opening the Sunday newspaper and tearing out each section and throwing them on the table.  Yes, it is a little messy, but it helps you feel good for awhile.  Further, at some point you can just discard it all and nothing was really lost beyond possibly feeling embarassed by people watching you or feeling inefficient.<p>* I think it also metaphorically better fits how I learn.
