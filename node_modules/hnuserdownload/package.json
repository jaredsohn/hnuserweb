  "readme": "# hnuserdownload\n\nDownloads Hacker News comments/submissions for a user.  Can be used as a module or from the commandline.\n\n## How to use\n\nInstall\n\n```bash\n$ npm install hnuserdownload\n```\n\nInclude the module and run\n\n```javascript\nvar hnuserdownload = require('hnuserdownload');\n    \nhnuser(id, function(err, results) {\n  if (err) console.log(err);\n  console.log(csv);\n});\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* Pages through results to get all comments and stories created by a user.\n* Optionally stores data as JSON and CSV\n\n## Limitations\n\n* Algolia (the source of the data) sets a limit of 1000 requests per hour.  If making heavy use of the API, make sure that you look at the num_requests output to limit usage so that you do not get banned.\n\n## Use as a module\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nvar hnuserdownload = require('hnuserdownload');\nhnuserdownload.hnuserdownload(\"pg\", function(err, results)\n{\n\tconsole.log(results);\n});\n```\n\nThere is also a method available to assist creating a CSV file.\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\n`hnuserdownload` can also be called from the command line\n\n```bash\nUsage: hnuserdownload username [json] [csv]\n```\n\n\nThe username is required. Include json and/or csv to create output files.  The files will be named automatically based on the username.\n      \n\n## Other ways to use it\n\nhnuserstats (in progress) makes use of this library and includes statistics.  That library will have a web frontend at [http://hnuser.herokuapp.com/] and Chrome extension frontend at [http://github.com/jaredsohn/hnkarmabreakdown].\n\n\n## About\n\nWritten by [Jared Sohn](mailto: jared.sohn@gmail.com).\n",
