(If you click the &#x27;+&#x27; sign after choosing a pickup location, it lets you choose the dropoff location.)  However, I was disappointed in that the driver still asked where I was going.  He recommended to me that I try out Sidecar instead, which asks you where you are going as its first question when you schedule a ride.<p>The second suggestion in the post was about indicating what kind of car to expect.

This thread had been talking about how one should take money from an accelerator if it offers a greater chance of success compared to the dilution it results in; it hasn&#x27;t compared the merits of YC versus other accelerators at all.  Your earlier comment mentioned how rational the decision was, but I&#x27;m saying that it isn&#x27;t rational based on what was written earlier in the thread since other programs weren&#x27;t taken into account at all.<p>That said, based on my understanding of the accelerator space, I&#x27;d probably prefer YC to other options.  Some reasons you maybe would prefer something else (guessing) would be if it conflicts with an accelerator that is very domain specific, although I&#x27;m not sure if such a situation would happen that couldn&#x27;t be worked around.","Was Y Combinator Worth It?",null,null,"http://wiwillia.com/post/80862769673/was-y-combinator-worth-it",null,null,1395966575

Conferences could even use membership in the women in tech groups as a way of certifying that people deserve the discounts similar to how a student ticket might require proving that one attends a university.<p>(These are just some ideas; one problem may be that some women in tech groups may also allow males to join, although it could be enough of a hurdle to prevent abuse.)","Girl Tickets to ng-conf",null,null,"http://reverse-disoma.tumblr.com/post/61474023482/i-find-this-offensive-i-get-that-the-intension-is",null,null,1379401546

After the game came out last year, I forked it to create MMO Spacewar (<a href=""http://www.mmospacewar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mmospacewar.com</a>) where the rules were adjusted to be more like the iconic game (user now has a single life but also an energy bar, new warp command, and movement, shooting and getting hit costs energy but you regain energy over time) and additional improvements were made (you cannot get killed right after spawning, fixed sound effects, and users can choose the instance via a hashtag URL.)<p>The fork also lets you create asteroids and spaceships (added back from the original one-player version of the game), although at the moment they are not shared among clients so other players may be confused at what you&#x27;re shooting at or is killing you.<p>One interesting aspect of this is that while developing I originally had my client playing on the MMO Asteroids Firebase table which in effect made this a cheat client (it can warp, not instantly killed).  But it is a slightly more ethical cheat client in that the player still can be killed, the total amount of mobility is limited, and you only get one ship so instead of pure cheating it is like adding another spaceship class to MMO Asteroids.<p>Edit: I didn&#x27;t have a lot of people to playtest with, so I&#x27;m not sure how much fun this actually is.  My early observation is that it might be too hard to kill people and that you tend to have the best luck if your opponent moves around a bunch to deplete their energy.","Firebase 404","","","https://www.firebase.com/404.html",null,null,1376094898

"2013-06-03T09:17:44.000Z",1,"comment","I think mobile development can be considered both frontend and backend, depending on the application and the context.  At least on iOS, an app is required to have user interaction so there will be a frontend component (if it is possible on other platforms to write code that the user doesn't interact with then there might not be a frontend component.)  If the app gathers information from the phone (such as collecting contacts, getting a list of other apps on the phone, etc.) or makes its own network calls then there is also a backend component.<p>Even if a mobile app has a backend component, if it connects to some server, then in a web context the app as a whole would be considered as frontend.

In the old design, you would have to do the equivalent of closing the compose window every time you wanted to look something up and then know that you have to go to the drafts folder to continue writing.  I imagine that often people would think they would have to start over again which would result in the drafts folder growing with many iterations.<p>I understand the critique presented in the OP, though.

"2013-03-01T05:54:57.000Z",4,"comment","Article text (there were also about three images):<p>Hackathons are bad for you.<p>I love developer communities. I love the spirit, the comradery and energy. But in the last couple of years or so, Hackthons have spread through the community like a plague. There are Hackathons around technologies, ideologies and everything in between. And I feel there is an urgent need to eradicate them.<p>Here is my main beef with Hackathon. Theyre encouraging and spreading a perverse culture of unhealthy lifestyle and unsustainable workflow which has been made popular by sensational media and film.<p>Heres a standard recipe for a Hackathon.<p>Gather a bunch of developers in a location.\nSupply them copious amounts of junk food, booze and caffeine.\nTell them to get cracking for 24hrs.\nSounds familiar?<p>Sleep<p>There is an almost masochistic take on sleep deprivation in the developer community. (It might be true with other professions, but lets focus on the devs.) Working late into the night and not sleeping for days is lauded and almost considered a necessity by many these days. Hackthons, many of which last 24hrs, only serve to glorify that.<p>It is well-known that sleep deprivation has only negative effects on health. Sadly, popular culture in the community has only strengthened the indifference towards health. Y-combinators popularized (and prefered?) archetype for founder/developers who eat ramen and code into the night, or the life of Mark Zuckerberg as showcased in the movie The Social Network only make things worse.<p>And leaving long-term health out of the equation, lack of sleep hasnt been known to improve your focus or the ability to be logical or creative, all of which are critical skills for developers.<p>When was the last time you wrote a piece of code while being totally sleep deprived, and looked at it after you woke up to say it was the most beautiful, elegant and awesome piece of code youve ever written?<p>A good nights rest and a fresh mind are critical for a good developer, thats one thing that Hackathons completely miss.<p>Food and Drink<p>Next to sleep, your body needs good fuel to keep going. And NO! I dont mean coffee. As much as I love my coffee, binging on coffee, red bull or is rarely good for focus. Not to mention alcohol, which makes matters worse.<p>Its a short-term vs long-term trade-off. Coffee (and possibly alcohol, although I am skeptical abt it), do help you feel more focused in the short-term. But both caffeine and alcohol are diuretics and only make you lose more water in the long-term. A dehydrated body isnt much of a help when you need your brain to focus and solve problems. When was the last time you saw an isotonic drink at a Hackathon?<p>Junk food isnt much of a help to that. I am not even going to touch on long-term effects of eating high carb diets. The usual Hackathon menu of pizza and candy is full of carbohydrates. While sugar highs are great for short-term focus (maybe??) you tend to feel hungry very quickly after a carb heavy meal. That only means you going around for another round of pizza/candy etc. Not really the best way to focus is it?<p>Sedentary lifestyle<p>More and more research is showing a link between a sitting lifestyle and health issues. Developers are unfortunate to have a job which is inherently sedentary. Hackthons again make it worse by inciting developers to sit at the same place for 24hrs. Im sure your back will thank you at the end of that!.<p>And whats worse is since most Hackathon are held on weekends, the one day you usually get to be active is also spent being sedentary.<p>Distraction<p>Hackathons are distraction. There are a ton of things going on. People are talking, discussing ideas, giving talks or just hanging out. All that is competing for your attention while you need to focus. Add caffeine to that mix and thats one hell of a party on thought in your mind. Noise cancelling headphones help, but then whats the point?<p>Solutions?<p>Im pretty sure there are better ways to organize hackthons. Having them over 2 days of 12hrs slots would be an idea, to combat sleep deprivation. Supplying and encouraging healthier eating and drinking options would be really useful. Fruits, nuts, and other healthy food are options. Similarly with drink, having access to isotonic drinks and lots of plain water should be a priority. Encouraging participants to do physical activities like calisthenics or just going out for walks on a regular schedule are options to consider.<p>But in the end, I really feel that Hackathons are beneficial less as a place and time to code out your next big idea, but more of a time to mingle and bond with the community. Its like a gathering of the tribe. And personally, there is more value in that than actually developing anything.<p>TL;DR; : Hackthons promote unhealthy lifestyle. If youre organizing one, urge your participants to hydrate regularly, eat healthy meals and take regular breaks where they do some type of physical activities.","Hackathons are bad for you","","","http://chinpen.net/blog/2013/02/hackathons-are-bad-for-you/",null,null,1362117297

"2012-07-19T10:14:19.000Z",6,"comment","I think you misread that article.  In the most basic sense, it isn't possible for Apple to get 44% profit margin when developers get 70%.<p>Here's how I understand the argument in the article (but keep in mind the numbers are as of 2010 so they aren't current.)<p>Basically, the article is saying that Apple claimed that developers earned $1 billion through 2010.  Since developers earn 70%, the total revenue coming into Apple would be a billion / .7 = 1.428 billion giving them a profit of $428 million (matching the figure in the article).  Then the article does some estimations about how much of that $428 million goes to the credit card company and is used for processing instead of being Apple's profit and calculates that Apple only gets 44% of their 30% as profit.  (Although comments on the article suggest that Apple might be able to get more favorable deals with the credit card company than what was used in the estimations.)<p>So if you trust the article's credit processing fee assumptions, then Apple gets $189 million of the $1.428 billion which is about 13%.  And if you factor in their costs for free apps ($81 million is cited in the article), the effective percentage becomes ((189-81)/189) * 13% = 7%.<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure these numbers are the right interpretation of the article.  Somebody in the comments mentioned that the 44% should be 14% net profit since it matches some graph that I haven't seen and that seems similar to the 13% I got in the above calculations.","Mozilla Wants Hundreds Of Thousands Of Firefox OS Developers","","","http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/mozilla-firefox-os-developer-86176",null,null,1342692859

I think this might have had the effect where people wouldn't see any e-mail address shared. (Although one can easily derive the @facebook.com e-mail address anyway.)<p>Also, this change just generally makes it harder to make use of other social sites.  Need the person's e-mail address to add them on LinkedIn?  Need to scrape e-mail addresses of your friends to invite them to another service (as was talked about a lot a few years ago)?  Can't do either in many cases if your friends just show their @facebook addresses.<p>Edit: Well, for LinkedIn that would only work if the person associated their facebook.com address with LinkedIn, which I don't think people do.  For the latter, it could still work but the person would strangely hear about the other service via Facebook (which I suppose Facebook could 'lose' those messages if it became a problem) and it could be hard to look people up by their more common e-mail addresses.","Facebook Changed Everyone's Email to Facebook.com; Here's How to Fix It","","","http://lifehacker.com/5921095/facebook-just-changed-your-email-without-permission-heres-how-to-get-it-back?utm_campaign=socialflow_lifehacker_facebook&utm_source=lifehacker_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow",null,null,1340649706

You would simply store the data that you would otherwise put in LocalStorage within a variable on the background page.  From the popup, you can access background page variables as members of the object returned by calling chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage().<p>The extension would still need to recompute it once every time it is starts up, but since it is computable I don't think it belongs in LocalStorage.  (You wouldn't store something like this in the registry if you were writing a Windows program; you'd just keep it in memory.)<p>Also, the article could use a bit of improvement in terminology.  When it talks about 'loading the extension', it really means displaying the popup.

(Google is aware of this and working on a fix (there is talk on the Chrome extension developers mailing list); just hoped to see the fix now.)<p>I believe they now sort them by 'usefulness' when up until a month ago or so they sorted them by date.  The current order is annoying because 1) the top reviews tend to be older and often talk about old bugs giving new potential users inaccurate impressions, 2) it is harder to see the new reviews (although the developer can log into a different interface and see them sorted by date), and 3) it makes conversations between the developer and users harder to follow.<p>The reason the last point is relevant is that for many users posting a review is the most obvious way to mention bugs.  They should let developers respond to individual reviews and provide optional links to a bug tracker and a forum to better move traffic there.<p>UPDATE: Noticed that it now only allows you to write one 'review' so a developer can no longer respond multiple times; hopefully some of the above suggestions will be implemented.<p>A couple of other unrelated changes I noticed:<p>* They include your Google profile info when you write a review; not sure if you can leave a review anonymously (beyond having an anonymous Google profile) anymore.<p>* They no longer show a count of how many people +1ed it (but still let you do so from there.)","Chrome Web Store have a new look","","","https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home?newlook",null,null,1319556237

(I agree that it looks less good now, but overall I don't think it was horribly bad from a financial perspective): <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/10/15/three-years-later-buying-myspace-looks-like-one-of-murdochs-smartest-bets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/10/15/three-years-later-buying-my...</a>","MySpace up for sale",null,null,"http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/02/news-corp-myspace-sale/",null,null,1296765188

Also in Airbnb's case, their famous living off of extra Cap'n McCain's cereal started prior to YC funding.","I will miss the old Y Combinator","","","http://scobleizer.com/2011/01/29/i-will-miss-the-old-y-combinator/",null,null,1296342197

One problem I've run across (which I'm thinking you also might have) is I end the day with a whole bunch of notepads open and it is a pain to save/close them.<p>If you have that problem, too, you should check out a program I wrote called Notepad Consolidator (<a href=""https://github.com/jaredsohn/NotepadConsolidator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jaredsohn/NotepadConsolidator</a>) that writes the contents of all open untitled notepads to an autonamed file.","How New Ideas Almost Killed Our Startup","","","http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/08/03/new-ideas-can-kill-your-startup/",null,null,1293054484

Unfortunately, this workaround applies more to app users than app developers.","Does the App Store 20MB 3G Download Limit Matter?","","","http://bonobolabs.com/does-the-app-store-20mb-3g-download-limit-matter/",null,null,1292910554

This way you get more people to start using your site and have a way to quickly get a credit card number.","Ask HN: Free trial vs money back guarantee","","","",null,null,1287519254
