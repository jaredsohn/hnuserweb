Here's my best guess as to why (which could possibly be useful in understanding why others do, too).<p>* Some sites (Netflix, banking sites, etc.) can be annoying to have to log back into and get to a certain page so I just keep them open.  Yes, some of those sites will expire the login anyway, but I don't know when I'll want to visit them again.<p>* Keeping tabs open just feels abundant and allows me to ignore having a certain discipline for awhile (closing tabs when done).  It kind of feels like opening the Sunday newspaper and tearing out each section and throwing them on the table.  Yes, it is a little messy, but it helps you feel good for awhile.  Further, at some point you can just discard it all and nothing was really lost beyond possibly feeling embarassed by people watching you or feeling inefficient.<p>* I think it also metaphorically better fits how I learn.  I like to build connections between my previous knowledge and things that I read.  Keeping something open after I'm done with it can be convenient in that I might discover it again later after learning related information (helping me to understand it in a different way).  Or perhaps the page has been updated with new comments that I don't care enough about to subscribe to, but would like to see again if I happen to run across it.

Here's my best guess as to why (which could possibly be useful in understanding why others do, too).<p>* Some sites (Netflix, banking sites, etc.) can be annoying to have to log back into and get to a certain page so I just keep them open.  Yes, some of those sites will expire the login anyway, but I don't know when I'll want to visit them again.<p>* Keeping tabs open just feels abundant and allows me to ignore having a certain discipline for awhile (closing tabs when done).  It kind of feels like opening the Sunday newspaper and tearing out each section and throwing them on the table.  Yes, it is a little messy, but it helps you feel good for awhile.  Further, at some point you can just discard it all and nothing was really lost beyond possibly feeling embarassed by people watching you or feeling inefficient.<p>* I think it also metaphorically better fits how I learn.
